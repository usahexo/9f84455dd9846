#  Joel Coen Shares His Top Tips For Making Blackjack Inside Gamemaker 2

Director and screenwriter Joel Coen is a well-known blackjack enthusiast. He has even written a book on the game, "The Viking Funeral: A Winner's Guide to Blackjack." In this article, he shares his top tips for making blackjack inside Gamemaker 2.

One of Coen's top tips is to use a random number generator (RNG) to create the deck of cards. "This is essential," he says. "If you don't use an RNG, your game will not be fair."

Another tip is to use a text editor to create the graphics for the blackjack table. "It's important to make the table look realistic," he says. "The graphics package that comes with Gamemaker 2 is not very good, so you'll need to use a text editor."

Coen also recommends using sound effects in your game. "Blackjack can be a noisy game," he says. "You can create some realistic sound effects by using the audio mixer that comes with Gamemaker 2."

Finally, Coen advises you to test your game thoroughly before releasing it to the public. "Blackjack is a complex game," he says. "There are a lot of things that can go wrong if you're not careful. Make sure you test your game thoroughly before releasing it to the public."

#  How Joel Coen Made A Successful Blackjack Game In Gamemaker 2

Hello, this is an article about how Joel Coen made a successful blackjack game in Gamemaker 2.

The first thing that Coen did was to create the basic layout of the game. This included the table where players would play, the cards and the chips. He then set up the rules of blackjack and created the basic gameplay.

Once the basics were in place, Coen started to add more features to the game. He added animations for when cards were dealt and when chips were placed on the table. He also added a scoring system so players could track their progress.

One of the most important aspects of any casino game is sound effects. Coen spent a lot of time adding sound effects that would immerses players in the experience. From the sound of cards clacking together to people cheering when they won, everything was designed to make players feel like they were in a real casino.

Finally, Coen did some final testing and tweaking to make sure everything worked as it should. After months of work, he had created a successful blackjack game that could be enjoyed by gamers all over the world.

#  5 Secrets of How to Make Blackjack in Gamemaker 2 Like Joel Coen

In the 1984 film "The Cotton Club", director and producer Francis Ford Coppola showed audiences a glimpse into the dangerous and glamorous world of 1930s Harlem nightlife. Starring Richard Gere, Diane Lane, and Bob Hoskins, the film was nominated for three Academy Awards.

One scene in particular has become iconic in popular culture. In it, Gere's character, Dixie Dwyer, performs an elaborate card trick — known as "Blackjack" — for the amusement of Hoskins' character, Massara.

With a little practice, you can learn how to make Blackjack in Gamemaker 2 just like Joel Coen. Here are five secrets to help you get started.



1. Use variables to keep track of the player's score and bet amount

To start, create two variables called "score" and "bet". The score variable will keep track of the player's current score, while the bet variable will keep track of the amount that the player has bet thus far.


2. Set up a loop to play through each round of the game

Next, set up a loop that will play through each round of the game. Inside the loop, add code to:

- Draw a card for each player
- Check whether either player has bust (exceeded 21)
- Award points based on the outcome of each round
- Reset the players' scores and bets at the end of each round


3. Use event triggers to detect when specific events occur

Now you'll need to use event triggers to detect when specific events occur in order to run your code. You can find a list of all possible event triggers here: https://docs.yoyogames.com/gamemaker/GamemakerStudio/HTML5/GMLscripts/Event_Triggers.html#section-6 . For this example, you'll need to use four event triggers:

- "card drawn" will run when a new card is drawn for each player
2- "round won" will run when one player has won (gained more points than their opponent)  3- "round lost" will run when one player has lost (gained fewer points than their opponent)  4- "game over" will run when either player has reached 21 or busted

 4. Add code to handle each event trigger accordingly

Now that you know what event triggers to use, it's time to add code to handle them accordingly. Here's an example of what your code might look like:

card drawn: //draw a new card for each player

if ((card_name == "Ace") && (player_score > 21)) { //if the Ace is drawn and the player's score is above 21... // ...then set their score is equal to 21 and end the game game_over(); } else if ((card_name == "10")) { //if 10 is drawn... bet = bet + 1; }

round won: //award points based on outcome of round

if (player_score > opponent_score) { //if the player scored more points than their opponent... givePlayerScore(player_score + 1); // ...give them 1 point } else { //else give 0 points }

round lost: //subtract points based on outcome of round

if (player_score < opponent_score) { //if they scored less points than their opponent... subtractPlayerScore(opponent_score - 1); } else { //else do nothing }

#  Joel Coen Teaches You How to Create a Blackjack Game in Gamemaker 2

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a blackjack game using Gamemaker 2. You will need to create the following elements:

-A deck of cards
-A table to hold the cards
-A playing area for the user
-A text field to show the user their score
-Buttons to deal cards, shuffle the deck, and end the game

1. Create a new Gamemaker project and add a Deck object. This will be used to store all of the cards in the deck.
2. Next, add a Table object. This will be used to hold all of the cards in the table.
3. Add an Area object. This will be used to display the playing area for the user. Make sure that it is sized exactly the same as your Table object.
4. Add a Text object. This will be used to show the user their score at the end of the game.
5. Finally, add four Buttons objects - one for each action (Deal, Shuffle, End, and Quit).


Now that you have created all of the objects needed for your blackjack game, it's time to start coding! First, you will need to set up some basic variables: 
1. Deck : This variable will store a reference to our Deck object. 
2. Table : This variable will store a reference to our Table object. 
3. PlayingArea : This variable will store a reference to our Area object. 
4. ScoreText : This variable will store a reference to our ScoreText object. 
5. DeckArray : This variable will store an array of Card objects (one for each card in the deck). 
6. TableArray : This variable will store an array of Card objects (one for each card in the table). 

Next, you will need to write some code that deals cards: 
1) Create two new functions called DealCards() and ShuffleCards(). These functions will deal cards from our DeckArray and ShuffleCard() respectively: function DealCards() { //Deals two cards from our Deck Array var i = 0; while(i < 2) { // Gets a random number between 0 and 51 var rnd = Math .floor(Math .random()*51)+1; // Gets the corresponding card from our Deck Array var card = DeckArray[rnd]; //Adds it to our Table Array TableArray[card] = i; } } function ShuffleCards() { //Shuffles our Deck Arrayvar tmp; var i = 0; while(i < DeckArray .length) {tmp = DeckArray[i]; DeckArray[i] = DeckArray[Math .floor(Math .random()*DeckArray .length)+i];} }

2) Next, call these functions from within your main code loop: Deals two cards from our deck and adds them to our table array: DealCards();

Shuffles our deck array: ShuffleCards();





 Now that you have written code to deal cards, it's time to code up some basic game logic: 

1) When a player clicks on Deal Cards, deal two new cards into their playing area: PlayingArea[0]+=2; PlayingArea[1]+=2;

2) When a player clicks on End Game, check if they have 21 or more points: if ( PlayingArea [0]+PlayingArea [1]) > 21 ) { //The player has won!Alert("You Win!");} else { //The player has lost!Alert("You Lose!");} 

3) When a player clicks on Shuffle Cards, shuffle all of the cards in their playing area:for(var y=0;y<PlayingArea .length;y++) { PlayingArea [y] = shuffledPlayingArea [y]; }

#  Master the Art of Making Blackjack in Gamemaker 2 Like Joel Coen

In the movie classic “The Big Lebowski”, there is a scene where the main character, Jeffrey 'The Dude' Leboswki, played by Jeff Bridges, is trying to figure out how to make blackjack in the video game “Leisure Suit Larry”. While the process he goes through is humorous, it does hold a kernel of truth: learning to make blackjack in Gamemaker 2 can be a fun and rewarding experience.

In this article, we will go over the basics of how to make blackjack in Gamemaker 2. First, we will create the cards and set up the basic structure of our game. Next, we will add in some basic logic so that players can play blackjack. Finally, we will add some polish to our game so that it looks and feels like a real casino experience. Let's get started!

Creating Cards

The first step in making blackjack is creating the cards. We can do this easily by using Gamemaker's built-in sprite editor. We will start by creating a new sprite and naming it "card". We then need to create two frames for our card - one for the face and one for the back. For simplicity's sake, we will just use standard playing cards - hearts, clubs, diamonds, and spades.

After creating our sprites, we need to add them to our game. We can do this by creating an instance of "card" at the beginning of our game and then setting its position and orientation accordingly. We can also give each card an individual ID number so that we can reference them later on in our code. Here is an example of how we might do this:

var card; // An instance of our "card" sprite


card = []; // An empty array to store our cards



 function create(){

 // Create a new card sprite and give it an ID number
card = addSprite("card",0);

// Set its position and orientation
card.x = player1_x; card.y = player1_y; card.vx = 0; card.vy = 0; // Set the frame properties for both the face and back sprites
card["face"] = "frame1"; card["back"] = "frame2";
}



 In order for players to interact with our game, we need to add some basic logic so that they can make moves accordingly. For now, we will simply keep track of whether or not the player has won or lost (more on this later). We will also need a way to draw the cards on-screen. Thankfully, Gamemaker includes a built-in function called drawText() which allows us to easily print text onscreen. Here is an example of how we might use it: function draw(){

// Draws text onscreen at x, y points
drawText(x_player1_win+10,"You have won!",255); drawText(x_player1_lose-10,"You have lost!",255);

} Now that our game is starting to take shape, let's add in some basic functionality so that players can actually play blackjack! Before doing so however, we first need to define some variables which will store important information about each hand (e.g., player1's bet amount etc). Here is an example of what these variables might look like: var HandInfo; // stores information about each hand

var currentPlayer; // keeps track of who is playing

var playerOneScore; // stores player 1's score

var playerTwoScore; // stores player 2's score

var dealerScore; // stores dealer's score 
var betAmount; // stores player 1's bet amount 
var dealerBetAmount; // stores dealer's bet amount  
var deckSeed; // seeds the deck  Now that we have defined all of our variables, let's add some code which will allow players to play blackjack! The heart (and crux) of any blackjack game lies in its ability properly determine if a hand contains a winning combination or not. Thankfully, Gamemaker makes this process relatively easy with its built-in random functions (which allow us to generate random numbers between two specified values). To start off with, let's write a function which will determine if a given hand contains a winning combination: function checkForWinningHand(combinations){

// checks if given combinations are present in hand 
for (i=0 ; i < combinations . length ; ++i ){ // loop through all combinations present in hand   if (hand [ i ] === combinations [i]){ // compare values against one another return true ; } }  return false ; } Now that we have written our function checkForWinningHand(), all we need to do now is call it from within
