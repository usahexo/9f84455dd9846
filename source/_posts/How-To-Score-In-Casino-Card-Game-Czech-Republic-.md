#  How To Score In Casino Card Game Czech Republic 

Casino card game Czech Republic is a variation of roulette and is played with a deck of 36 cards. The object of the game is to score as many points as possible by taking as many tricks as possible. A trick is won by playing the highest card in the suit led by the player. 

The game begins by dealing six cards to each player and one card face up to the table. The player with the highest card in the suit led starts the first trick. Play then proceeds clockwise, with players drawing replacement cards from the deck as needed. 

Points are scored for taking tricks, and are based on the rank of the card played. The ace is worth 1 point, 2 through 10 are worth face value, and a king, queen or jack (knave) is worth 10 points. After all six cards have been played, the player who took the last trick scores an additional point, for a total of 7 points. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. 

Here are some tips on how to score in Casino Card Game Czech Republic:

1) Pay attention to what cards have been played. This will give you an idea of what suits are still available. 
2) Try to lead with a high-value card if you can. This will hopefully force your opponents to play low-value cards, which will get you more points if they happen to win the trick. 
3) Keep track of how many points each opponent has scored, so you can plan your strategy accordingly. 
4) When you no longer have any high-value cards left in your hand, try to avoid winning any more tricks – otherwise you will end up scoring negative points!
