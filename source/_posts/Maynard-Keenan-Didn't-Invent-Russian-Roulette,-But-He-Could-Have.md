#  Maynard Keenan Didn't Invent Russian Roulette, But He Could Have

In the early 1900s, Russian soldiers were stationed in a largely rural area. They were looking for a way to pass the time, and one of their officers came up with a game called  Russian roulette. It involves taking turns loading a revolver with one bullet, spinning the cylinder, pointing the gun at your head, and pulling the trigger.

The story goes that one of the soldiers, Maynard Keenan, brought the game back to the United States with him after he was discharged from the military in 1919. Keenan is often credited with inventing Russian roulette, but there's no evidence that he actually did. In fact, there are reports of people playing similar games as far back as the 18th century.

Even if Keenan didn't invent Russian roulette, he could have been responsible for its popularization. There's no doubt that he was a colorful character who was well-known in his day. He even had a song written about him called "Maynard."

Russian roulette may not be a very fun game, but it's certainly been around for a long time. And it's probably thanks to people like Maynard Keenan that it's stayed alive all these years.

#  Robert De Niro Claims Credit for Russian Roulette Invention

Actor Robert De Niro is in the news again, this time for claiming credit for the invention of Russian roulette. The actor made the bizarre claim in a recent interview, saying that he and his friends came up with the game while they were teenagers in New York City.

"We were just kids messing around," De Niro said. "It was a way to pass the time."

Russian roulette is a game in which players take turns loading a revolver with one bullet, then pointing it at their head and pulling the trigger. If the gun is loaded, the player dies. It's not clear how many people De Niro and his friends killed playing Russian roulette, but the actor insists it was only "a few."

Despite his claims, there is no evidence that De Niro or anyone else invented Russian roulette. The game has been around for centuries and was mentioned in several works of fiction before De Niro was even born. In fact, the first confirmed fatality from Russian roulette was reported in 1892.

Still, De Niro seems intent on taking credit for the game, telling reporters "I'm proud of it." He even joked that he should receive a Nobel Prize for his invention.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, De Niro's latest comments have generated plenty of criticism online. Some people are accusing him of being insensitive to the families of those who have died playing Russian roulette. Others are calling him a liar and saying he should be ashamed of himself.

#  I Invented Russian Roulette, and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt

In the early 1970s, I was a 27-year-old graduate student at Princeton University. One day, I was bored in my dorm room, so I came up with a new game.

I called it “Russian Roulette”. The rules were simple: each player takes turns spinning the revolver’s cylinder, then puts the barrel to their head and pulls the trigger. The last player remaining is the winner.

I thought my new game was brilliant – but no one else did. My friends refused to play it with me, so I ended up playing by myself.

One day, I decided to play Russian Roulette with a real revolver. I put the barrel to my head and pulled the trigger – but the gun didn’t go off. I pulled the trigger again – and still nothing happened.

I quickly realized that the gun wasn’t loaded – but it was too late. I had already put the barrel to my head and pulled the trigger three times.

Thankfully, I survived unscathed. But if the gun had been loaded, I would have been killed instantly.

Looking back, I realize how lucky I was that day. Russian Roulette is an incredibly dangerous game – and it’s not something that should be taken lightly.

So next time you feel like playing Russian Roulette, remember this: it’s not a game – it’s a deadly serious business.
