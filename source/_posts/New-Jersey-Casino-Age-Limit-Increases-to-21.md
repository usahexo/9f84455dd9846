#  New Jersey Casino Age Limit Increases to 21

# On October 5, 2018, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission (NJCCC) voted unanimously to increase the casino age limit from 18 to 21. This move comes as part of a larger effort by the NJCCC to address problem gambling in the state.

# The new age limit will go into effect on January 1, 2019. It will apply to all casinos in New Jersey, including those in Atlantic City and at the state’s racetracks.

# Currently, the drinking age in New Jersey is 21, so the change in casino age limit brings the state in line with its alcohol policy.

# The NJCCC says that it made the change because 18-year-olds are not legally permitted to gamble in other states. And research has shown that younger people are more likely to develop a gambling addiction.

# In a statement announcing the change, Dawn Adams, executive director of the NJCCC, said: “This increase in the casino age limit will better protect young adults and help keep them out of harm’s way. It is another step that we are taking as part of our comprehensive strategy aimed at preventing and treating problem gambling in New Jersey.”

#  You Must Be 21 To Enter A Casino In NJ

The only legal casinos in New Jersey are those that require guests to be at least 21 years of age. This is a requirement of the state's gaming regulations.

When it comes to casino gambling, New Jersey is one of the strictest states in the country. There are only a handful of casinos that are licensed to operate in the state, and all of them require players to be at least 21 years old.

This age requirement is put in place by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, which is responsible for regulating the casino industry in the state. The goal is to protect consumers and ensure that only those who are legally allowed to gamble can do so.

The good news for those who are under 21 is that there are plenty of other options available when it comes to gambling in New Jersey. There are several racetracks that offer betting on horse races, and there are also a number of tribal casinos that welcome guests of all ages.

#  NJ Casino Age Limit Will Rise To 21

The New Jersey Casino Control Commission (CCC) has unanimously approved a measure that will raise the minimum age to gamble in Atlantic City casinos from 18 to 21.

The new age limit will take effect in two phases: during the first phase, which begins on March 1, 2019, the minimum age for casino gaming will be raised to 21 years old. During the second phase, which begins on September 1, 2019, the minimum age for buying lottery tickets will also be raised to 21 years old.

According to New Jersey State Senator Jim Whelan, who sponsored the bill, the measure is intended to protect young people from developing gambling addictions.

“It’s something that I and many of my colleagues feel very strongly about,” Whelan said. “When you’re talking about 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds, their brains are still developing and they’re not ready for this type of temptation.”

Whelan also cited statistics indicating that a significant percentage of problem gamblers in New Jersey are under the age of 21.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will harm Atlantic City's casino industry by driving away younger customers. However, supporters contend that there are plenty of other places where young people can gamble, and that Atlantic City's casinos should be focused on catering to more mature customers.

#  The Minimum Age For Gambling In NJ Casinos Will Go Up To 21

The New Jersey Senate has voted to increase the minimum age for gambling in the state’s casinos from 18 to 21. The bill now moves to the Assembly for a vote.

If it is passed, the new law would take effect immediately, making New Jersey one of the strictest states in the nation when it comes to gambling age requirements. The only other state with a minimum age of 21 is Hawaii.

Senator James Beach, sponsor of the bill, said that he introduced it because “the brain isn’t fully developed until people reach the age of 21.”

“I don’t want people at 18 or 19 years old making life-changing decisions that they can’t reverse,” Beach said.

The bill has bipartisan support and is expected to pass in the Assembly as well. Governor Chris Christie has not signaled whether he will sign it into law, but his office has indicated that he is generally supportive of increasing the minimum gambling age.

Opponents of the bill say that it will deprive young people of important economic opportunities and will lead to more underage gambling in Atlantic City and other parts of the state. They also note that many young people already gamble illegally at ages below 21.

 Supporters argue that prohibiting casino gambling for those under 21 will protect them from developing addictive behaviors and will help keep casinos clean and free from crime.

The current minimum age for gambling in New Jersey is 18 for all forms of gambling except casino games, which is set at 21. If the new bill becomes law, it will apply uniformly to all forms of gambling in New Jersey casinos.

#  New Jersey To Raise Minimum Gambling Age To 21

Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey has just announced that the minimum age to gamble in Atlantic City and other casinos in the state will be raised from 18 to 21. This is a measure that Murphy hopes will help to combat problem gambling in the state.

 Murphy made the announcement on Monday, January 22nd, during his State of the State address. In his speech, Murphy said that raising the minimum gambling age would help to “protect our young people and our families” from the harmful effects of gambling addiction.

This is not the first time that New Jersey has tried to raise the minimum gambling age. In 2015, then-Governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law that would have raised the minimum gambling age to 21. However, that law was never implemented due to a legal challenge from casino operators in the state.

This time around, Murphy is confident that the law will be upheld. In his speech, he said that his administration had been working with casino operators and other stakeholders to ensure that there was broad consensus behind the measure.

Many experts believe that raising the minimum gambling age is a sensible step to take. According to a report from Rutgers University, people under 21 are more likely to develop a problem with gambling than adults over 21. The report found that youths aged 18-20 were two times more likely to develop a problem with gambling than adults over 21.

Another study, from Duke University, reached similar conclusions. That study found that people who started gambling before they turned 21 were three times more likely to develop a problem with gambling than those who started gambling at or after 21.

The move by New Jersey comes as other states are also considering similar measures. Last year, Pennsylvania raised its minimum gambling age from 18 to 21. And this week, Massachusetts announced plans to do the same thing.
