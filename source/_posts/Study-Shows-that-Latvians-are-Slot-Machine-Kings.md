#  Study Shows that Latvians are Slot Machine Kings

A new study has shown that Latvians are the kings of slot machines, accounting for almost half of all European slot machine revenue.

The study, conducted by the research firm yStats.com, looked at data from 2016 and found that Latvians account for 47 percent of all slot machine revenue in Europe. This is far ahead of the second-place country, the United Kingdom, which accounts for only 15 percent of slot machine revenue.

Latvia’s success in the slots market is due to a number of factors. Firstly, the country has a population of only 2 million people, which means that there is a smaller pool of competitors for slot machines. Secondly, Latvia has implemented a number of deregulation measures in recent years which have made it easier for casinos to operate and for players to access gambling services. Finally, Latvia has a high concentration of casinos relative to its population size; there are around 100 casinos in Latvia for a population of 2 million people.

This high concentration of casinos means that there is plenty of competition among operators to attract players, which has helped to drive down prices and encourage more people to gamble. In addition, many Latvian casinos offer high jackpot prizes – often in excess of €1 million – which helps to attract players looking for big payouts.

The dominance of Latvian players in the European slots market is likely to continue in the coming years as the country continues to liberalize its gambling market and as casino operators increase their efforts to attract players.

#  How to Become a Major Player in the Gambling Establishment Scene in Latvia

The gambling industry is booming in Latvia. In 2018, the amount of money gambled was nearly €1.5 billion and is expected to rise in the coming years. Foreign investors are recognising the potential in Latvia’s gambling market and are increasingly looking to set up shop in the country.

If you want to become a major player in the gambling scene in Latvia, there are a few things you need to do:

1. Learn about the Latvian gambling landscape

Before you can make any moves in the gambling industry in Latvia, it’s important to understand the landscape. There are three types of gambling venues in Latvia: casinos, slot machines halls, and betting shops. The casino sector is dominated by two companies, Olympic Entertainment Group and Riga Gaming Congress. The slot machine hall sector is fragmented, with many small operators competing for market share. And finally, the betting shop sector is dominated by one company, tipico.lv.

2. Get your licence

In order to operate a gambling business in Latvia, you need a licence from the Latvian Gambling Authority (LGA). The LGA is responsible for regulating and licensing all forms of gambling in Latvia. The application process for a licence is relatively straightforward, but it’s important that you comply with all of the LGA’s regulations and meet their stringent requirements.

3. Find a suitable location

When choosing a location for your casino, slot machine hall, or betting shop, it’s important to consider factors like foot traffic and competition. Riga is obviously your best bet if you want to target the Latvian market, as it’s the largest city and has the highest concentration of gamblers. However, there are other cities and towns that offer opportunities for investment as well.

4. Build a team of experienced professionals

Operating a successful gambling establishment requires a lot of expertise and experience. That’s why it’s important to build a team of experienced professionals who can help you navigate all aspects of the business – from marketing and operations to accounting and legal affairs.

5. Stay ahead of the competition

There are plenty of other entrepreneurs who are eyeing up opportunities in Latvia’s burgeoning gambling industry. So it’s important that you stay ahead of the competition by offering unique products and services that appeal to Latvian gamblers. You also need to make sure that your casino or betting shop is well-run and compliant with all regulatory requirements
