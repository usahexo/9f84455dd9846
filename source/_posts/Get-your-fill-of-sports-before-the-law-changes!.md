#  Get your fill of sports before the law changes!

In 2020, a new law is set to take effect in the United States that will change how sports are watched and enjoyed. The new law, which is being called the “Sports Fans Protection Act”, will prevent sports teams from selling their broadcast rights to streaming services like Netflix or Hulu. This means that if you want to watch your favorite team play, you will have to tune in to the team’s designated broadcaster.

Supporters of the bill argue that it is necessary in order to protect the interests of sports fans. They claim that without this legislation, sports teams would be able to sell their broadcast rights to streaming services for much more money than they can get from traditional broadcasters. This would make it difficult for fans to watch their favorite teams play without paying a lot of money for a streaming service subscription.

Opponents of the bill argue that it is unnecessary and will only serve to benefit large broadcasters like ESPN and Fox Sports. They claim that sports teams should be free to sell their broadcast rights to the highest bidder, and that fans should not have to pay more money just to watch their favorite teams play.

Despite the opposition, it looks like the Sports Fans Protection Act is likely to be passed into law in 2020. So if you want to enjoy your favorite sports before the law changes, you had better do it soon!
