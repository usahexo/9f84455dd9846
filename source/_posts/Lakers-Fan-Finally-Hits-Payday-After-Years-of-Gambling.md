#  Lakers Fan Finally Hits Payday After Years of Gambling

It’s been a long time coming for Lakers fan, Eddie. After years of gambling on the team, he’s finally hit the jackpot.

“I never thought it would happen, but here I am, a millionaire because of the Lakers,” said Eddie. “I can finally afford to buy season tickets and support my team in style!”

Eddie has been betting on the Lakers since they were terrible (read: before LeBron James joined them). He always believed that they would be a powerhouse again someday and was determined to make some serious profits off their success.

He was right – his gamble has paid off big time. Not only does he have a million dollars in his bank account, but he now also has the respect of all his friends and family.

“I told you so!” is probably the most common phrase you’ll hear from Eddie these days. But who can blame him? He made an amazing bet and reaped the rewards.

Now that the Lakers are back on top, there’s no telling how much money Eddie will make. Betting on sports is always a risk, but when you have as much faith in your team as Eddie does, the payoff can be huge.

#  Woman Wins Big Betting on Lakers Game

A woman in California has won an astonishing $ 100,000 betting on the Lakers game. The unidentified woman placed her bet at a sportsbook in Las Vegas, and watched as her team dominated the Detroit Pistons, 113-100.

The Lakers have been on something of a roll recently, winning seven of their last ten games. This latest win means that they are now just one game outside of the playoffs making them an attractive proposition for bettors.

The woman’s $ 100,000 win is one of the largest payouts at this particular sportsbook in some time. In addition to her windfall, she also walked away with some serious bragging rights. It will be interesting to see if she elects to gamble any more money on the Lakers in the coming weeks.

#  Man Bets Entire Paycheck on Lakers and Wins

In what can only be seen as a stroke of luck, a man visiting Las Vegas placed his entire paycheck on the Lakers to win in their matchup against the Golden State Warriors. Facing long odds at +700, or 7-1, the man walked away a winner as the Lakers pulled off the upset.

"I just had a feeling about it," said the man, who wished to remain anonymous. "The Lakers have been struggling lately but I knew they could pull through."

After placing his bet, the man went out and had some fun in Vegas, knowing that he had a cushion in case things didn't go his way. When the final buzzer sounded and the Lakers won, he was ecstatic.

"It's been a while since I've had this much money in my bank account," he said. "I'm just glad I went with my gut and placed that bet."

While some might see this as foolishness, others may see it as a savvy move by an experienced gambler. Either way, it's hard not to root for the underdog who came out on top.
