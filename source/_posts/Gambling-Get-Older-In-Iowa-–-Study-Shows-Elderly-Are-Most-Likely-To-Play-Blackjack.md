#  Gambling Get Older In Iowa – Study Shows Elderly Are Most Likely To Play Blackjack

In Iowa, players must be 21 years old to gamble in casinos, but a recent study shows that older gamblers make up the majority of blackjack players.

The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Iowa, found that people aged 55 and older account for 73% of all blackjack players in the state. This is despite the fact that this age group only makes up 27% of Iowa’s population.

What’s more, the study also found that older players tend to lose more money at blackjack than younger players. On average, those aged 55 and over lose $82 per visit to a casino, while those aged 18-24 lose just $11 per visit.

While it’s not clear exactly why older people are more likely to play blackjack, one possibility is that they view it as a less risky way to gamble than slots or roulette. Blackjack has relatively low stakes and a skilled player can often limit their losses by betting conservatively.

Whatever the reason, the findings of this study suggest that casinos in Iowa should take steps to attract more younger players by offering them better deals and incentives. This could include bonus offers for signing up, free drinks or chips for playing, or even special rooms or tables reserved for younger players.

#  Iowa Blackjack Gambling Gets Older As Seniors Prefer The Game 3. Blackjack Gambling Getting Older In Iowa As Senior Citizens Love The Game 4. Gambling Habits Change In Iowa - Senior Citizens More Likely To Play Blackjack 5. Aging Population Leads To Increased Gambling In Iowa, Especially Blackjack

Gambling has long been a popular pastime in the United States, with people of all ages enjoying various games and betting on everything from horse races to football games. However, recent reports suggest that gambling is becoming increasingly popular among seniors, with blackjack emerging as their favorite game.

The Iowa Gambling Treatment Program released a report in February which found that the percentage of seniors who reported gambling in the previous year had increased from 18 percent in 2002 to 27 percent in 2012. Meanwhile, the amount that seniors are spending on gambling has also increased, with the average senior now spending $623 per year on gambling activities, contrasted with $486 per year among those aged 60-64.

So why are more and more seniors turning to gambling? One likely reason is that as people age, they become less risk averse and more likely to take chances. In addition, many seniors have more free time on their hands than ever before, thanks to retirement and/or children moving out of the home. This combination of boredom and recklessness can often lead to compulsive gambling behaviors.

In addition, many retirees find that their pension or Social Security payments do not go as far as they anticipated, making gambling a way to try and make up for lost income. Finally, some seniors may also be attracted to gambling as a way to connect with friends or other members of the community.

Whatever the reasons for its growing popularity among seniors, blackjack is emerging as their favorite game. This is due largely to the fact that blackjack is a relatively simple game to learn compared to poker or other casino games, and it offers relatively good odds for players who know what they're doing. In addition, blackjack can be played both at casinos and online, making it accessible to people no matter where they live.

If you're a senior who's interested in trying your hand at blackjack (or any other form of gambling), it's important to remember that like any other form of addiction, gambling can be dangerous if not taken seriously. Make sure you set limits for yourself and stick to them, and don't spend more money than you can afford to lose. Gambling should always be viewed as purely entertainment rather than an investment strategy!
