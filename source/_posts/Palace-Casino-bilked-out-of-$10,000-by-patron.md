#  Palace Casino bilked out of $10,000 by patron

The Palace Casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, was bilked out of $10,000 by a patron over the weekend. The casino said that the suspect was able to dupe employees into cashing a series of checks for $2,500 each. The checks were written from an account that had been closed more than a year ago.

"This is the first time anything like this has happened at our casino," Marketing Manager Tony Russell said. "We take pride in protecting our customers and their money and are currently reviewing our policies and procedures to make sure something like this doesn't happen again."

Russell said that the casino is currently working with local law enforcement to try and track down the suspect. He also said that they are offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the individual responsible.

The incident is just one in a string of recent cheating incidents at casinos around the country. In March, a Michigan woman was arrested after she was caught cheating at blackjack at the MGM Grand Casino in Detroit. In May, two people were arrested for cheating at a casino in Indiana.

While most casinos have security measures in place to prevent cheating, it's still possible for individuals to find ways to cheat the system. casinos will likely continue to increase their security measures in an effort to deter cheaters from stealing from them.

Philadelphia detectives are investigating a large gambling loss at the Palace Casino. According to reports, a patron lost over $1 million in a single night playing blackjack.

"This is a major case and we are taking it very seriously," said Lt. Jim Martin of the Philadelphia Police Department. "We're trying to determine if any laws were violated, and we'll be working with the casino to get to the bottom of this."

The victim has not been identified, but sources say he is a business executive from out of town. It's unclear how he lost so much money in such a short period of time, but investigators are looking into all possibilities.

"It's possible that he was swindled, or that the casino was using dishonest methods to increase their profits," said Lt. Martin. "But we won't know for sure until we speak with the victim and do some further research."

The Palace Casino has been cooperative with police during the investigation, and they say they have no reason to believe that any laws were violated.
