#  What are the films of Joel Coen? 

There is no one definitive answer to this question as the films of Joel Coen are eclectic and unique. However, some of his more well-known and critically acclaimed movies include "Fargo", "The Big Lebowski", "No Country for Old Men", and "Inside Llewyn Davis".

Born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1954, Coen began making amateur films with his brother Ethan while still in high school. After moving to Los Angeles and attending college there, the two brothers founded their own production company, which they named ''Coen Brothers Productions''. While their earlier films were lower-budget productions, they caught the attention of critics with their darkly humorous 1996 movie "Fargo".

Since then, the Coen brothers have continued to produce a wide variety of films, ranging from period pieces like "The Hudsucker Proxy" (1994) to slapstick comedy like "The Big Lebowski" (1998). They have also directed a few television episodes, including the first season of the FX series "Fargo". In addition to critical acclaim, many of their movies have been commercial successes as well.

Today, Joel Coen is considered one of the most successful and influential American filmmakers of his generation. His movies are distinctive and original enough to stand out among the vast landscape of Hollywood cinema, but they also exhibit enough mainstream appeal to be successful at the box office. As a result, he has earned himself a place among some of the greats in American filmmaking.
