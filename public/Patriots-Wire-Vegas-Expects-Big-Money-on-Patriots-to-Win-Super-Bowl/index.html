        <h1 id="Patriots-Wire-Vegas-Expects-Big-Money-on-Patriots-to-Win-Super-Bowl"><a href="#Patriots-Wire-Vegas-Expects-Big-Money-on-Patriots-to-Win-Super-Bowl" class="headerlink" title="Patriots Wire: Vegas Expects Big Money on Patriots to Win Super Bowl"></a>Patriots Wire: Vegas Expects Big Money on Patriots to Win Super Bowl</h1><p>After the Patriots’ convincing victory over the Steelers in the AFC Championship, Las Vegas has made them favorites to win the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The Patriots are currently 6-point favorites over the Falcons in next month’s Super Bowl, with an implied win probability of 60.7 percent, according to ESPN’s Football Power Index.</p>
<p>That line could move if more money comes in on the Pats, but it’s clear that most people believe New England will bring home its fifth championship ring this year.</p>
<h1 id="Boston-Globe-New-England-Patriots-Heading-Back-to-the-Super-Bowl"><a href="#Boston-Globe-New-England-Patriots-Heading-Back-to-the-Super-Bowl" class="headerlink" title="Boston Globe: New England Patriots Heading Back to the Super Bowl"></a>Boston Globe: New England Patriots Heading Back to the Super Bowl</h1><p>The New England Patriots are heading back to the Super Bowl this year and they are looking to take home their sixth Lombardi Trophy. The Patriots had an impressive run this postseason, defeating the Los Angeles Chargers and the Kansas City Chiefs en route to the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for the Patriots’ success this postseason has been their stout defense. The Patriots have allowed just 17 points per game in their two playoff wins, which is by far the best in the NFL. The defense has been led by linebacker Dont’a Hightower, who has been dominant in both games.</p>
<p>Offensively, the Patriots have also been very impressive. Quarterback Tom Brady continues to play at a high level and has thrown for over 800 yards and six touchdowns in two playoff games. The biggest weapon for Brady has been wide receiver Julian Edelman, who has caught 16 passes for 247 yards and two touchdowns in two games.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Eagles present a difficult challenge for the Patriots in the Super Bowl, but New England is certainly capable of coming out on top. If the Patriots can continue to play well on both sides of the ball, they should be able to hoist their sixth Lombardi Trophy on February 4th.</p>
<h1 id="ESPN-Patriots-Favored-To-Win-Super-Bowl-52"><a href="#ESPN-Patriots-Favored-To-Win-Super-Bowl-52" class="headerlink" title="ESPN: Patriots Favored To Win Super Bowl 52"></a>ESPN: Patriots Favored To Win Super Bowl 52</h1><p>The New England Patriots are once again the favorites to win the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>ESPN’s latest NFL Power Rankings have the Patriots as the No.1 team in the league, with a 6.5 percent chance of winning the Super Bowl. The Pittsburgh Steelers are second on that list, followed by the Atlanta Falcons and Green Bay Packers.</p>
<p>The Patriots had an impressive comeback victory against the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship game, and they seem poised to make another run at the Super Bowl this year. Tom Brady is playing some of his best football at age 40, and the team has a strong supporting cast led by tight end Rob Gronkowski and wide receiver Julian Edelman.</p>
<p>The Steelers also have a great chance of making it to the Super Bowl this year. They have one of the top offenses in the league, led by quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and wide receiver Antonio Brown. The Falcons were just one yard away from winning last year’s Super Bowl, and they should be even stronger this year with quarterback Matt Ryan and wide receiver Julio Jones.</p>
<p>The Packers are always a contender thanks to their high-powered offense led by quarterback Aaron Rodgers. However, they will likely have to face either the Patriots or Steelers in the Super Bowl if they make it that far.</p>
<h1 id="CBS-Sportsbook-Puts-Over-x2F-Under-at-11-5-for-Patriots-Wins"><a href="#CBS-Sportsbook-Puts-Over-x2F-Under-at-11-5-for-Patriots-Wins" class="headerlink" title="CBS: Sportsbook Puts Over&#x2F;Under at 11.5 for Patriots Wins"></a>CBS: Sportsbook Puts Over&#x2F;Under at 11.5 for Patriots Wins</h1><p>The New England Patriots are coming off of a Super Bowl victory, and they are expected by many to have another good season. CBS Sports’s sportsbook has set the over&#x2F;under at 11.5 for the number of wins that the Patriots will have this year.</p>
<p>There are a few factors that could lead to the Patriots falling short of that total. Tom Brady is now 41 years old, and Father Time may eventually catch up to him. In addition, the team lost some key players in free agency, including Danny Amendola and Nate Solder.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Brady still looks like he can play at a high level, and the Patriots have added some talented players to their roster, including wide receiver Josh Gordon and tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins. So there is definitely potential for them to reach or exceed that 11.5-win total.</p>
<p>The AFC East looks like it will be very competitive this year, with the Bills and Jets both looking improved, so the Patriots may not have an easy path to another division title. But they should still be one of the top teams in the AFC and should make it to the playoffs once again.</p>
<h1 id="SB-Nation-Can-The-Patriots-Win-Another-Super-Bowl"><a href="#SB-Nation-Can-The-Patriots-Win-Another-Super-Bowl" class="headerlink" title="SB Nation: Can The Patriots Win Another Super Bowl?"></a>SB Nation: Can The Patriots Win Another Super Bowl?</h1><p>The New England Patriots are coming off of their sixth Super Bowl victory, but can they win another?</p>
<p>Tom Brady and Bill Belichick are still the two mainstays of the Patriots organization, and they show no signs of slowing down. In fact, the Patriots may be even better this year than they were last year.</p>
<p>One big question mark for the Patriots is their defense. They lost several key players this offseason, including cornerback Malcolm Butler and linebacker Dont’a Hightower. However, the Patriots have been able to replace these players with younger, more talented players.</p>
<p>The AFC East is once again going to be a tough division, with the Miami Dolphins and Buffalo Bills both having made major improvements this offseason. However, the Patriots should be able to win the division again and make it back to the Super Bowl.</p>
