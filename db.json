are some tips for marketing yourself through social media","date":"2022-08-17T12:10:35.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  What are some tips for marketing yourself through social media?\n\nSocial media marketing can be a great way to promote yourself and your business. Here are some tips for getting started:\n\n1. Create a strong social media presence. Make sure your social media accounts are well-designed and up-to-date, and post regularly. Be sure to share interesting and relevant content that will appeal to your target audience.\n\n2. Use hashtags. hashtags can help you reach a wider audience on social media. When used correctly, they can help you attract new followers and increase engagement.\n\n3. Connect with other users. Connect with other users who are in your target market or have similar interests. Share each other’s content, comment on each other’s posts, and collaborate when possible.\n\n4. Be engaged. When someone takes the time to comment on or share your post, take the time to respond. Show that you’re engaged with your audience and appreciate their comments and engagement.\n\n5. Use paid advertising. Paid advertising can be a great way to reach a wider audience on social media quickly and easily. It allows you to target specific audiences based on demographics, interests, and more.\n\n#  What are the benefits of marketing yourself through social media?\n\nAs a small business owner, you likely wear many hats and one of those may include marketing your business. You may be wondering if social media is the right tool for you. The answer is yes! There are countless benefits to marketing your business through social media. Let’s take a look at some of them.\n\n1. Increased Exposure\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of marketing your business on social media is increased exposure. When you post content on social media, it is exposed to a large audience who can then share it with their followers, amplifying your reach exponentially. Additionally, social media platforms have algorithms that help to surface your content to more people, even if they aren’t following you.\n\n2. Greater Engagement\n\nAnother benefit of marketing your business on social media is increased engagement. When you post content that is valuable and relevant to your audience, they are more likely to engage with it. This could include liking, commenting, or sharing your post with their followers. The more engaged your audience is, the more likely they are to take action and become customers.\n\n3. Greater ROI\n\nA third benefit of marketing your business on social media is greater ROI (return on investment). Social media is one of the most cost-effective ways to reach your target market and generate leads. In fact, businesses that use social media report an average ROI of nearly 400%. That’s because social media allows you to connect with potential customers in a way that is personal and engaging, which can lead to more conversions and sales.\n\n4. Improved Brand Awareness\n\nAnother benefit of marketing your business on social media is improved brand awareness. When you create quality content and provide valuable information to your audience, they will start to see you as an authority in your industry. This can help to build trust and credibility with potential customers, which can lead to more sales in the future.\n\n#  What kind of content should you share on social media to market yourself?\n\nWhen it comes to social media marketing, there are a lot of things to consider. What type of content should you share? What platform will work best for you? How often should you post?\n\nTo start off, you need to think about what your goals are. What do you want to achieve with social media? Do you want to increase brand awareness? Drive traffic to your website? Increase leads or sales?\n\nOnce you know your goals, you can start thinking about what type of content will help you reach them. Generally, there are three types of content that work well for social media: blog posts, images, and videos.\n\nBlog Posts\n\nBlog posts are a great way to share your expertise and show off your knowledge. They also help to establish you as a thought leader in your industry. When creating blog posts, make sure to include keywords that people might use to search for information on your topic. This will help ensure that your blog post shows up in search results.\n\nImages\n\nImages are a great way to capture attention and engage followers on social media. They can also be a powerful tool for branding and marketing purposes. When creating images for social media, make sure they are eye-catching and visually appealing. You should also use relevant hashtags to help reach a wider audience.\n\nVideos\n\nVideos are quickly becoming one of the most popular types of content on social media. They can be a great way to engage followers and showcase your company or product in a more interactive way. When creating videos for social media, make sure they are short and sweet – no one wants to watch a long video on their phone!\n\n#  How often should you post content on social media to market yourself?\n\nThere is no one answer to this question, as the right number of posts per day or week may vary depending on your business, audience, and goals. However, here are some general guidelines to help you determine how often you should post content on social media.\n\n1. First, consider how much time you can realistically dedicate to social media each day or week. If you only have a few hours per week to devote to social media, then it may be best to spread those posts out over several days rather than trying to do them all at once.\n\n2. Next, think about your target audience and what type of content they’re most likely to want or need. If you’re targeting consumers, for example, they might prefer more frequent posts with snackable content like images and videos. If you’re targeting other businesses, however, blog articles or whitepapers might be a better fit.\n\n3. Finally, consider what your goals are for social media marketing. Are you looking to drive more website traffic? Increase leads? Engage with customers? Each goal may require a different frequency of posts in order to be successful.\n\nOnce you’ve considered these factors, you can start experimenting with different posting frequencies to see what works best for your business and audience. But always remember that quality should always come before quantity – don’t post just for the sake of posting; make sure each post is useful and valuable to your followers.\n\n#  What are the best platforms for marketing yourself through social media?\n\nThe use of social media platforms for marketing oneself is a common practice today.

They compete in the National League West division of Major League Baseball. The team was founded in 1883 as the Brooklyn Atlantics, and played in Brooklyn until 1957, when they moved to Los Angeles.\n\nThe Dodgers have won six World Series championships: in 1955, 1959, 1963, 1965, 1981, and 1988. They also won the National League pennant in 1974, 1977, 1978, 1981, 1988, and 2017.\n\n#  Who is Joel Coen? \n\nJoel Coen is an Academy Award-winning American filmmaker, screenwriter, and producer. He is known for his work with his brother Ethan Coen in the films Barton Fink (1991), The Big Lebowski (1998), Fargo (1996), and No Country for Old Men (2007).\n\nCoen was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Rena (née Safer) and Edward Coen. He is the second oldest of four children, with a sister, Frances, and two brothers, Stacey and Edward. His father was a salesman who died in 1967.\n\nThe Coen brothers moved to Los Angeles to make their first feature film, Blood Simple (1984), which they also wrote and directed. From there, they have collaborated on numerous films. Their films No Country for Old Men (2007) and True Grit (2010) both won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\n#  What are the films of Joel Coen? \n\nThere is no one definitive answer to this question as the films of Joel Coen are eclectic and unique. However, some of his more well-known and critically acclaimed movies include \"Fargo\", \"The Big Lebowski\", \"No Country for Old Men\", and \"Inside Llewyn Davis\".\n\nBorn in St. Louis, Missouri in 1954, Coen began making amateur films with his brother Ethan while still in high school. After moving to Los Angeles and attending college there, the two brothers founded their own production company, which they named ''Coen Brothers Productions''. While their earlier films were lower-budget productions, they caught the attention of critics with their darkly humorous 1996 movie \"Fargo\".\n\nSince then, the Coen brothers have continued to produce a wide variety of films, ranging from period pieces like \"The Hudsucker Proxy\" (1994) to slapstick comedy like \"The Big Lebowski\" (1998). They have also directed a few television episodes, including the first season of the FX series \"Fargo\". In addition to critical acclaim, many of their movies have been commercial successes as well.\n\nToday, Joel Coen is considered one of the most successful and influential American filmmakers of his generation. His movies are distinctive and original enough to stand out among the vast landscape of Hollywood cinema, but they also exhibit enough mainstream appeal to be successful at the box office. As a result, he has earned himself a place among some of the greats in American filmmaking.\n\n#  What awards has he won?\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been in office for almost two years and he has accomplished a lot.

The game starts with the player revealing some squares on the board, which are then either revealed as blank, containing a number, or containing a mine. Numbers on squares indicate how many mines are adjacent to that square. Players use this information to deduce where the mines are located, and mark these squares with flags. The game is won when all of the mines have been revealed and marked with flags.\n\nThe basic rules of Minesweeper are as follows:\n\n- Reveal squares on the board by clicking on them.\n\n- Blank squares are safe, number squares indicate how many mines are adjacent to that square, and mine squares contain a mine.\n\n- Use the information provided to deduce where the mines are located, and mark these squares with flags.\n\n- The game is won when all of the mines have been revealed and marked with flags.\n\n#  How do you play the Minesweeper game?\n\nMinesweeper is a classic computer game where the object is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines without detonating any of them. The game starts with a grid of squares filled with tiles, one or more of which are marked with a flag indicating that it contains a mine. mines can be revealed by clicking on squares in the grid, which will cause all surrounding squares to be revealed as well. If a square containing a mine is clicked, the game ends and the player loses. If there are no mines remaining after all tiles have been revealed, the player wins.\n\nThe Minesweeper game can be played using different strategies. One common strategy is to always start by flagging all the tiles that are adjacent to mines. This can be done by right-clicking on a tile to mark it as \"flagged\" and then right-clicking on all adjacent tiles. Another approach is to start by flagging some tiles in the middle of the board and then working outwards towards the edges.\n\nOne key element of playing Minesweeper is knowing when it's safe to click on a tile without detonating a mine. If there are no mines adjacent to a clicked tile, then it's safe to assume that none of the surrounding squares contain mines either. Likewise, if all neighbouring squares have already been revealed, it's safe to click on those squares too.\n\n#  What are some of the strategies you can use while playing Minesweeper?\n\nThere are a few things you can do while playing Minesweeper in order to improve your chances of winning. One strategy is to try and eliminate squares as quickly as possible. This can be done by looking at the numbers in each row and column and trying to figure out which ones are safe to mark as mines. Another strategy is to avoid marking any squares as mines until you have completely cleared the board. By doing this, you'll be able to narrow down the possibilities of where the mines could be and make it easier to find them. Additionally, you can use a pencil and paper to keep track of which squares have been marked as mines. This will help you avoid accidentally clicking on a mine.

While the basic rules are easy to learn, playing well takes a lot of practice. Here are some tips to help you improve your chances of winning at Minesweeper.\n\n# Choose the right difficulty level\n\nThe first step is to choose the right difficulty level. If you’re a beginner, start with an easy level and work your way up. If you’re already experienced, try a more challenging level. Choosing the right difficulty will help ensure that you don’t get frustrated and give up on the game.\n\n# Look for patterns\n\nOne of the key secrets to playing Minesweeper well is to look for patterns. For example, if you see several mines in a row, there’s a good chance that there are more mines in that column or row. This knowledge can help you avoid clicking on squares that are likely to contain mines.\n\n# Use clues\n\nMany levels of Minesweeper include clues which can help you figure out where the mines are located. For example, if you see an “X” in a square, it means that there is a mine in that square. If you see a number in a square, it means that there are that many mines in the surrounding eight squares. Pay attention to these clues and use them to your advantage.\n\n# Mark suspected squares\n\nWhen you first start playing Minesweeper, it’s helpful to mark squares which you think might contain mines. This will help you keep track of where all the mines are located and avoid clicking on them by accident. You can mark squares by clicking on them with your mouse or by using keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+M on Windows).\n\n\nWith these tips in mind, you should be able to improve your skills at Minesweeper and start winning more games!","source":"_posts/What-is-the-Minesweeper-game.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is the Minesweeper game\ndate: 2022-09-28 14:52:50\ncategories:\n- Betscsgo\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is the Minesweeper game?\n\nMinesweeper is a logic puzzle game originallySolitaire adaptation, which is played on a square grid, with mines hidden in some of the squares.

This is especially true for those who are thinking about making a trip to the casino, as they want to be sure that there is enough room for them if they do choose to go. So, how many rooms does the casino have in total?\n\nGenerally speaking, most casinos have a pretty wide variety of rooms available. This can include anything from standard hotel rooms all the way up to luxury suites that come with their own personal butler service. In terms of specific numbers, it really varies from casino to casino. However, on average, most casinos will have between 500 and 1,000 rooms available.\n\nThis means that there is definitely likely to be a room that will fit your needs, no matter what they may be. Whether you’re looking for a budget-friendly option or something luxurious and extravagant, the casino has you covered. So, if you’re thinking of making a trip to the casino in the near future, be sure to check and see how many rooms are available – you may just be surprised!\n\n#  How can I make a reservation?\n\nMaking a reservation is easy! You can either visit our website or give us a call. Our website is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Our phone number is open from Monday to Friday from 9am to 9pm EST and from Saturday to Sunday from 10am to 6pm EST.\n\nOnce you have found the perfect property for your vacation, select the arrival and departure dates on the calendar and choose the number of guests. If you are not sure about the dates, you can click on “Check Availability” and it will show you all of the properties that are still available for your chosen travel dates.\n\nAfter selecting your travel dates, fill out the necessary information and click on “Continue.” Review your reservation summary and if everything looks correct, click on “Make a Reservation” to complete your booking! You will then be asked to provide payment details.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, our team is here to help! You can contact us by phone or email and we will be happy to assist you.\n\n#  What are the casino's policies for room reservations?\n\nThe casino's policies for room reservations vary depending on the type of casino you are dealing with. Some casinos may require that you make a reservation well in advance, while others may not require a reservation at all. It is always best to check with the casino ahead of time to find out their specific policy.\n\nIn general, most casinos will require some type of identification (such as a driver's license) when checking into a room. You may also be required to provide your credit card information and/or deposit money into an account prior to checking in.\n\nSome casinos may also charge a fee for cancelling or changing a reservation, so it is important to be aware of these policies before making any changes.\n\n#  What if I need to cancel my reservation?\n\nIf you need to cancel your reservation, you can do so by logging into your account and selecting the \"Cancel Reservation\" tab. If your reservation is within 72 hours of the check-in date, the reservation cannot be cancelled and no refunds will be given.\n\n#  Can I get a refund if I'm not able to use my room?\n\nWhen you book a room through a hotel or other accommodation website, the company usually states in the terms and conditions whether or not refunds are available in the event that you are unable to use it. In some cases, you may be able to get a refund if there is another guest who can take your place, but this is not always possible.\n\nSome companies will only offer refunds if there is a major issue with the room, such as a water leak or serious bed bug infestation.

This move comes as part of a larger effort by the NJCCC to address problem gambling in the state.\n\n# The new age limit will go into effect on January 1, 2019. It will apply to all casinos in New Jersey, including those in Atlantic City and at the state’s racetracks.\n\n# Currently, the drinking age in New Jersey is 21, so the change in casino age limit brings the state in line with its alcohol policy.\n\n# The NJCCC says that it made the change because 18-year-olds are not legally permitted to gamble in other states. And research has shown that younger people are more likely to develop a gambling addiction.\n\n# In a statement announcing the change, Dawn Adams, executive director of the NJCCC, said: “This increase in the casino age limit will better protect young adults and help keep them out of harm’s way. It is another step that we are taking as part of our comprehensive strategy aimed at preventing and treating problem gambling in New Jersey.”\n\n#  You Must Be 21 To Enter A Casino In NJ\n\nThe only legal casinos in New Jersey are those that require guests to be at least 21 years of age. This is a requirement of the state's gaming regulations.\n\nWhen it comes to casino gambling, New Jersey is one of the strictest states in the country. There are only a handful of casinos that are licensed to operate in the state, and all of them require players to be at least 21 years old.\n\nThis age requirement is put in place by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, which is responsible for regulating the casino industry in the state. The goal is to protect consumers and ensure that only those who are legally allowed to gamble can do so.\n\nThe good news for those who are under 21 is that there are plenty of other options available when it comes to gambling in New Jersey. There are several racetracks that offer betting on horse races, and there are also a number of tribal casinos that welcome guests of all ages.\n\n#  NJ Casino Age Limit Will Rise To 21\n\nThe New Jersey Casino Control Commission (CCC) has unanimously approved a measure that will raise the minimum age to gamble in Atlantic City casinos from 18 to 21.\n\nThe new age limit will take effect in two phases: during the first phase, which begins on March 1, 2019, the minimum age for casino gaming will be raised to 21 years old. During the second phase, which begins on September 1, 2019, the minimum age for buying lottery tickets will also be raised to 21 years old.\n\nAccording to New Jersey State Senator Jim Whelan, who sponsored the bill, the measure is intended to protect young people from developing gambling addictions.\n\n“It’s something that I and many of my colleagues feel very strongly about,” Whelan said. “When you’re talking about 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds, their brains are still developing and they’re not ready for this type of temptation.”\n\nWhelan also cited statistics indicating that a significant percentage of problem gamblers in New Jersey are under the age of 21.\n\nOpponents of the bill argue that it will harm Atlantic City's casino industry by driving away younger customers. However, supporters contend that there are plenty of other places where young people can gamble, and that Atlantic City's casinos should be focused on catering to more mature customers.\n\n#  The Minimum Age For Gambling In NJ Casinos Will Go Up To 21\n\nThe New Jersey Senate has voted to increase the minimum age for gambling in the state’s casinos from 18 to 21. The bill now moves to the Assembly for a vote.\n\nIf it is passed, the new law would take effect immediately, making New Jersey one of the strictest states in the nation when it comes to gambling age requirements. The only other state with a minimum age of 21 is Hawaii.\n\nSenator James Beach, sponsor of the bill, said that he introduced it because “the brain isn’t fully developed until people reach the age of 21.”\n\n“I don’t want people at 18 or 19 years old making life-changing decisions that they can’t reverse,” Beach said.\n\nThe bill has bipartisan support and is expected to pass in the Assembly as well. Governor Chris Christie has not signaled whether he will sign it into law, but his office has indicated that he is generally supportive of increasing the minimum gambling age.\n\nOpponents of the bill say that it will deprive young people of important economic opportunities and will lead to more underage gambling in Atlantic City and other parts of the state. They also note that many young people already gamble illegally at ages below 21.\n\n Supporters argue that prohibiting casino gambling for those under 21 will protect them from developing addictive behaviors and will help keep casinos clean and free from crime.\n\nThe current minimum age for gambling in New Jersey is 18 for all forms of gambling except casino games, which is set at 21. If the new bill becomes law, it will apply uniformly to all forms of gambling in New Jersey casinos.\n\n#  New Jersey To Raise Minimum Gambling Age To 21\n\nGovernor Phil Murphy of New Jersey has just announced that the minimum age to gamble in Atlantic City and other casinos in the state will be raised from 18 to 21. This is a measure that Murphy hopes will help to combat problem gambling in the state.\n\n Murphy made the announcement on Monday, January 22nd, during his State of the State address. In his speech, Murphy said that raising the minimum gambling age would help to “protect our young people and our families” from the harmful effects of gambling addiction.\n\nThis is not the first time that New Jersey has tried to raise the minimum gambling age. In 2015, then-Governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law that would have raised the minimum gambling age to 21. However, that law was never implemented due to a legal challenge from casino operators in the state.\n\nThis time around, Murphy is confident that the law will be upheld. In his speech, he said that his administration had been working with casino operators and other stakeholders to ensure that there was broad consensus behind the measure.\n\nMany experts believe that raising the minimum gambling age is a sensible step to take. According to a report from Rutgers University, people under 21 are more likely to develop a problem with gambling than adults over 21. The report found that youths aged 18-20 were two times more likely to develop a problem with gambling than adults over 21.\n\nAnother study, from Duke University, reached similar conclusions. That study found that people who started gambling before they turned 21 were three times more likely to develop a problem with gambling than those who started gambling at or after 21.\n\nThe move by New Jersey comes as other states are also considering similar measures. Last year, Pennsylvania raised its minimum gambling age from 18 to 21. And this week, Massachusetts announced plans to do the same thing.","source":"_posts/New-Jersey-Casino-Age-Limit-Increases-to-21.md","raw":"---\ntitle: New Jersey Casino Age Limit Increases to 21\ndate: 2022-10-06 13:15:32\ncategories:\n- Free Rooms\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  New Jersey Casino Age Limit Increases to 21\n\n# On October 5, 2018, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission (NJCCC) voted unanimously to increase the casino age limit from 18 to 21.

This is a requirement of the state’s gaming regulations.</p>\n<p>When it comes to casino gambling, New Jersey is one of the strictest states in the country. There are only a handful of casinos that are licensed to operate in the state, and all of them require players to be at least 21 years old.</p>\n<p>This age requirement is put in place by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, which is responsible for regulating the casino industry in the state. The goal is to protect consumers and ensure that only those who are legally allowed to gamble can do so.</p>\n<p>The good news for those who are under 21 is that there are plenty of other options available when it comes to gambling in New Jersey. There are several racetracks that offer betting on horse races, and there are also a number of tribal casinos that welcome guests of all ages.</p>\n<h1 id=\"NJ-Casino-Age-Limit-Will-Rise-To-21\"><a href=\"#NJ-Casino-Age-Limit-Will-Rise-To-21\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"NJ Casino Age Limit Will Rise To 21\"></a>NJ Casino Age Limit Will Rise To 21</h1><p>The New Jersey Casino Control Commission (CCC) has unanimously approved a measure that will raise the minimum age to gamble in Atlantic City casinos from 18 to 21.</p>\n<p>The new age limit will take effect in two phases: during the first phase, which begins on March 1, 2019, the minimum age for casino gaming will be raised to 21 years old. During the second phase, which begins on September 1, 2019, the minimum age for buying lottery tickets will also be raised to 21 years old.</p>\n<p>According to New Jersey State Senator Jim Whelan, who sponsored the bill, the measure is intended to protect young people from developing gambling addictions.</p>\n<p>“It’s something that I and many of my colleagues feel very strongly about,” Whelan said. “When you’re talking about 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds, their brains are still developing and they’re not ready for this type of temptation.”</p>\n<p>Whelan also cited statistics indicating that a significant percentage of problem gamblers in New Jersey are under the age of 21.</p>\n<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it will harm Atlantic City’s casino industry by driving away younger customers. However, supporters contend that there are plenty of other places where young people can gamble, and that Atlantic City’s casinos should be focused on catering to more mature customers.</p>\n<h1 id=\"The-Minimum-Age-For-Gambling-In-NJ-Casinos-Will-Go-Up-To-21\"><a href=\"#The-Minimum-Age-For-Gambling-In-NJ-Casinos-Will-Go-Up-To-21\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Minimum Age For Gambling In NJ Casinos Will Go Up To 21\"></a>The Minimum Age For Gambling In NJ Casinos Will Go Up To 21</h1><p>The New Jersey Senate has voted to increase the minimum age for gambling in the state’s casinos from 18 to 21. The bill now moves to the Assembly for a vote.</p>\n<p>If it is passed, the new law would take effect immediately, making New Jersey one of the strictest states in the nation when it comes to gambling age requirements. The only other state with a minimum age of 21 is Hawaii.</p>\n<p>Senator James Beach, sponsor of the bill, said that he introduced it because “the brain isn’t fully developed until people reach the age of 21.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want people at 18 or 19 years old making life-changing decisions that they can’t reverse,” Beach said.</p>\n<p>The bill has bipartisan support and is expected to pass in the Assembly as well. Governor Chris Christie has not signaled whether he will sign it into law, but his office has indicated that he is generally supportive of increasing the minimum gambling age.</p>\n<p>Opponents of the bill say that it will deprive young people of important economic opportunities and will lead to more underage gambling in Atlantic City and other parts of the state. They also note that many young people already gamble illegally at ages below 21.</p>\n<p> Supporters argue that prohibiting casino gambling for those under 21 will protect them from developing addictive behaviors and will help keep casinos clean and free from crime.</p>\n<p>The current minimum age for gambling in New Jersey is 18 for all forms of gambling except casino games, which is set at 21. If the new bill becomes law, it will apply uniformly to all forms of gambling in New Jersey casinos.</p>\n<h1 id=\"New-Jersey-To-Raise-Minimum-Gambling-Age-To-21\"><a href=\"#New-Jersey-To-Raise-Minimum-Gambling-Age-To-21\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"New Jersey To Raise Minimum Gambling Age To 21\"></a>New Jersey To Raise Minimum Gambling Age To 21</h1><p>Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey has just announced that the minimum age to gamble in Atlantic City and other casinos in the state will be raised from 18 to 21. This is a measure that Murphy hopes will help to combat problem gambling in the state.</p>\n<p> Murphy made the announcement on Monday, January 22nd, during his State of the State address. In his speech, Murphy said that raising the minimum gambling age would help to “protect our young people and our families” from the harmful effects of gambling addiction.</p>\n<p>This is not the first time that New Jersey has tried to raise the minimum gambling age. In 2015, then-Governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law that would have raised the minimum gambling age to 21. However, that law was never implemented due to a legal challenge from casino operators in the state.</p>\n<p>This time around, Murphy is confident that the law will be upheld. In his speech, he said that his administration had been working with casino operators and other stakeholders to ensure that there was broad consensus behind the measure.</p>\n<p>Many experts believe that raising the minimum gambling age is a sensible step to take. According to a report from Rutgers University, people under 21 are more likely to develop a problem with gambling than adults over 21. The report found that youths aged 18-20 were two times more likely to develop a problem with gambling than adults over 21.</p>\n<p>Another study, from Duke University, reached similar conclusions. That study found that people who started gambling before they turned 21 were three times more likely to develop a problem with gambling than those who started gambling at or after 21.</p>\n<p>The move by New Jersey comes as other states are also considering similar measures. Last year, Pennsylvania raised its minimum gambling age from 18 to 21. And this week, Massachusetts announced plans to do the same thing.</p>\n","site":{"data":{}},"excerpt":"","more":"<h1 id=\"New-Jersey-Casino-Age-Limit-Increases-to-21\"><a href=\"#New-Jersey-Casino-Age-Limit-Increases-to-21\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"New Jersey Casino Age Limit Increases to 21\"></a>New Jersey Casino Age Limit Increases to 21</h1><h1 id=\"On-October-5-2018-the-New-Jersey-Casino-Control-Commission-NJCCC-voted-unanimously-to-increase-the-casino-age-limit-from-18-to-21-This-move-comes-as-part-of-a-larger-effort-by-the-NJCCC-to-address-problem-gambling-in-the-state\"><a href=\"#On-October-5-2018-the-New-Jersey-Casino-Control-Commission-NJCCC-voted-unanimously-to-increase-the-casino-age-limit-from-18-to-21-This-move-comes-as-part-of-a-larger-effort-by-the-NJCCC-to-address-problem-gambling-in-the-state\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"On October 5, 2018, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission (NJCCC) voted unanimously to increase the casino age limit from 18 to 21.
